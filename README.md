# Tone.js-Drumcomputer / -Step-Sequencer v.0.1.3

### Just a simple drumcomputer/step-sequencer using [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).  
This is just a small project to get to know the basics of Tone.js and to find out what the Web Audio API is capable of.
More of a Step-Sequencer than a real drum computer, but who cares

### Currently, in very early alpha state
